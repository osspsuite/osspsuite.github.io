See this thread for what's going on here: [https://mobile.twitter.com/bmdube/status/1054449168725360641][the-twoot]

Stay tuned to [@osspsuite][org-twitter] and this space for updates. Discourse or Mattermost, or both, will
be available soon for project discussions.

The purpose of this organization is to collaborate on a set of services and applications, a host-your-own
alternative to things like Google's G Suite.

The first service I'm going to work on is an alternative to Google Keep. Google doesn't need to know what's
on my shopping list.
