So many people are asking <sup>who?</sup>, is the project dead? what's going on?

No, it's not dead yet <sup>proof?</sup>. Things are busy. I'm reorganizing my own servers and infrastructure
at the moment.

What I'm thinking is to create services based on Docker images, for easy self-hosting. There are options
in this space other than Docker, but Docker is what I know at the moment. If you're set up for OpenShift
or something else but would like to participate, then please sing out. I don't yet know what it would take
to support both, but I'm open to find out.

See this thread for what's going on here: [https://mobile.twitter.com/bmdube/status/1054449168725360641][the-twoot]

Stay tuned to [@osspsuite][org-twitter] and this space for updates. Discourse or Mattermost, or both, will
be available soon for project discussions.

The purpose of this organization is to collaborate on a set of services and applications, a host-your-own
alternative to things like Google's G Suite.

The first service I'm going to work on is an alternative to Google Keep. Google doesn't need to know what's
on my shopping list.
